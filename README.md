## üõ†Ô∏è Building & Compiling

### Using Hardhat

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm init -y
npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers
```

2. Initialize project:
```bash
npx hardhat
```
Place your `.sol` file into `Contracts/`.

Update `hardhat.config.js` with the compiler version and optimizer settings listed on PolygonScan.

Compile the contracts:
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

# Example hardhat.config.js
```js
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers");
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan");

module.exports = {
  solidity: {
    version: "0.8.17", // Match PolygonScan verified compiler version
    settings: {
      optimizer: {
        enabled: true,
        runs: 200 // Match optimizer runs shown on PolygonScan
      }
    }
  },
  networks: {
    polygon: {
      url: "https://polygon-rpc.com",
      accounts: [process.env.DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY]
    }
  },
  etherscan: {
    apiKey: {
      polygon: process.env.POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY
    }
  }
};
```

## üì° Fetch ABI & Metadata with Thirdweb CLI

To fetch ABI and metadata of the deployed contract:
```bash
npx thirdweb@latest contract get \
  --address 0xa6cC027c3Bba1793B53b626974Ba1f38321F356b \
  --chain polygon > thirdweb-contract.json
```

## ‚úÖ Verifying Contracts Locally

Install Hardhat Etherscan plugin:
```bash
npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan
```
Add `POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY` to your environment.

Verify contract:
```bash
npx hardhat verify --network polygon 0xa6cC027c3Bba1793B53b626974Ba1f38321F356b "<constructorArg1>" "<constructorArg2>"
```
> Use the exact compiler version, optimizer settings, and constructor arguments shown on PolygonScan.
